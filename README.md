# Task-Quest-Swift-App
First Swift app in development and is still a work in progress

This is my first Swift app that I have created and I am still in the process of completing it. This app uses Core Data, basic animations, and some custom design.

This app is a reminder app but with a RPG style. Instead of reminders, we have Quests. Usually in RPG games a Quest is given by another person, where they will give you additional information and a completion date. So, an outline of a new Quest consits of: Quest Title, Quest Giver, Notes, and a completion date. 

As in any RPG game there is a hero, you! So after completing your quests you gain XP points that add to your character and this allows you to level up. (This is still in progress and not finished yet.)
